Do you want roots

Question about quotations: I have noted that the API, by default, returns the oldest quotes first.

In the console app, do you want the quotes displayed most recent first? For example, a quotation from 700 AD is probably less likely to be helpful then a quotation from 1980.  Ideally, the most recent quotes are displayed first?

2.) Do you want, by default, all quotations saved for supermemo export or only the displayed quotations?  Right now it is only saving the quotations you see in the actual app.
