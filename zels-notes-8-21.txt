Hi Luke
on dynamic export, its still a vague idea in my mind. Not sure about it how it will work or if it is needed
I am going to test the file you sent yesterday

I need pronunciation cards too. They will work like this: IPA symbols on front ; the word on the back. There are two pronunciations American and British. We can have two tags A for American B for british.
mail P  gets me both American and British
mail  PB  gets me just British
mail PA gets me  just American
P Tag is for pronunciation. If you can think of other better tags we can add them instead of the ones i gave above

Excellent work on the incremental export feature. 
I am still getting this error when filtering out obsolete senses with the Sense endpoint. You can try the word "clog" to test it.  It returns obsolete senses too. I think this is the problem with the Sense endpoint as if i run the same query with qs it does filter out obsolete senses

for the next version prioritize these functions:
1) qs feature for individual definition and  senses 
2)separation of years parameters
3)pronunciation cards

another improvement suggestion:  When we want to feed a previous definition to sense endpoint or a sense to quote endpoint we can just use numbers. For example, when i queried for the word 'clog' and wanted to get the senses of definition 2 i typed    sense d 2  . We can remove the parameter d and just add the number of the definition we want e.g. sense 2 in the above case to get all the senses of definition 2 of clog

Cf is a bit buggy.sometimes it dels the old xml when i just type cf but at others it doesnt
also cf does not work with qs feature
